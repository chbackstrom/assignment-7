## **Package Title**

For this assingment, I have chosen to review the Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) package, created by Dr. Andrew Jackson and Dr. Andrew Parnell.

## **Location**

You can download this package on the web both via CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SIBER/index.html) and via Andrew Jackson's Github repository (https://github.com/AndrewLJackson/SIBER).

## **Vignette(s)**

The CRAN repository for the SIBER package offers 11 vignettes demonstrating different features of the R code calculations and their interpretation. Topics covered in these vignettes range from vector statistics on stable isotope biplot centroids to plot customization to differences between comparing community and population isotope biplots.

## **Application(s)**

The SIBER package can be used to calculate the overlap in isotopic niche space (e.g., biplots of carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 signatures) between two or more groups of organisms (such as species, populations, or communities) to determine the trophic similarity/difference between these groups. SIBER biplots have appeared in scientific articles in various areas of biology and ecology since the initial creation of the package in 2011.

## **Review**

The primary purpose of the SIBER package is to compare the trophic state of different groups of organisms (e.g., different populations or species) by generating biplots of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic signatures and producing bayesian ellipses to statistically compare the overlap in signatures between those different groups.
